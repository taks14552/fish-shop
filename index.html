It's important to<br> avoid overfeeding goldfish, as they can easily become overweight and suffer from health <br>issues.<br><br>

Goldfish can live for several years with proper care and attention. They are social animals<br> and enjoy the company of other goldfish, so it's recommended to keep them in groups of two <br>or more. Goldfish also have unique personalities and can even recognize their owners,<br> making them a fun and rewarding pet to keep.
